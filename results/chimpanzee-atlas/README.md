# Probabilistic Atlas of the Chimpanzee BA44 and BA45

This folder contains the probabilistic atlas of cytoarchitectural areas BA44 and BA45 in the chimpanzee template (JUNA).

To visualize and manipulate these files you will need the [Connectome Workbench](https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench).

When visualizing th results, please notice that you need to load a surface file (`.surf.gii`) in the [Connectome Workbench](https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench) before loading any atlas file (`.func.gii`).

### `./JUNA-surface-reconstructions (folder)`
3D reconstructions of the JUNA chimpanzee brain template. A variety of surfaces are available:
- White surface: 3D reconstruction of the white-matter surface
- Pial surface: 3D reconstruction of the gray-matter surface
- Inflated: Inflated version of the gray matter, for better visualization purposes
- Sphere: Spherical mapping of the cortical surface, useful for cortical registrations.
